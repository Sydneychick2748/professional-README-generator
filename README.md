This project is built in node.js and uses the npm package inquirer. The readme can be updated at any time  in the terminal, and by starting node index.js and answering a set of questions that will be promted in the comand-line.  The input that the user addes in the command-line will generate a professional README file.

## Installation
 
First, I cloned the starter code, made a repo, and named it. There were all ready files with index.js and a folder called utils, and in that folder, there is a generate markdown .js file. Then I added an output folder where the readme file would be generated. I installed the npm inquirer and the the package-lock JSON and node in the terminal. Also added my own README file for this assignment as well.
To run the project, you must enter the terminal in the vs code and enter node index.js.
